# Varsity Hackathon 2025
## Domain: AI & Data Science
## CASE STUDY 1: Self-Learning Trading Strategies

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: This is just an Hackathon project. There are NO guarantees of profitability. Trading involves substantial risk of loss.**

This project explores the potential of [artificial financial intelligence](https://www.afi.xyz) - a focused implementation of AI for trading and investing research.

## üéØ Vision
I'm researching AI agents for trading that may eventually leverage [AFI](https://www.afi.xyz). This is experimental research, not a profitable trading solution.

## üí° Concept
AI agents might help address common trading challenges:
- Emotional reactions
- Ego-driven decisions
- Inconsistent execution
- Fatigue effects
- Impatience
- Fear & Greed cycles

While we use the RBI framework for strategy research, we're exploring AI agents as potential tools. We're in early stages with LLM technology, investigating possibilities in the trading space.

## üó∫Ô∏è Research Roadmap

### 1. Risk Control Agents
Exploring AI agents that could assist with risk management. This is purely experimental research into risk oversight possibilities.

### 2. Exit Agents
Researching potential exit timing assistance. This overlaps with risk management research but focuses on position management concepts.

### 3. Entry Agents
Investigating entry-focused concepts after risk management research.

### 4. Sentiment Collection Agents
Exploring ways to gather market sentiment from Twitter, Discord, and Telegram for research purposes.

### 5. Strategy Algo Execution Agents
Researching concepts like:
- Multi-agent consensus
- Strategy validation
- Dynamic trade filtering
